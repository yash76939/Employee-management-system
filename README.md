# React + Vite


🚀 Project Showcase: Employee Management System 💼
I’m excited to share my latest web development project — Employee Management System, built from scratch using React.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

🔧 Tech Stack:

⚛️ React.js for building dynamic user interfaces

🎨 Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean styling

🌐 HTML & JavaScript for structuring and functionality

🛠️ Features:

Add, update, delete employee records

Real-time search and filtering

User-friendly and responsive UI

Efficient data handling with React state management

This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and apply best practices in component-based architecture and modern styling.

📌 Check it out and let me know your feedback!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
